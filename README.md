# Traffic_Analysis_and_Prediction

This is an ongoing capstone project by Team Scipy. This is our final Capstone Project in the Hamoye 2022 Summer Internship.


# Introduction

Traffic congestions is rising in cities around the world. Contributing factors include expanding urban populations, aging infrastructure, inefficient and uncoordinated traffic signal timing and a lack of real-time data. Given the physical and financial limitations around building additional roads, cities must use new strategies and technologies to improve traffic conditions.

In this project, we will analyze the provided Traffic dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/traffic-prediction-dataset). The provided dataset includes hourly traffic data on four different junctions in a particular city.


# Aim of the Project

The aim of this project is to derive insights from this analysis and then build a model/models that can be used to predict traffic at particular times at the different junctions in the city.


# Instructions For Team

 - The Traffic_Prediction_EDA ipynb file is our main ipynb file that will be used for feature engineering/modelling and deployment
 
 - The traffic excel file contains the original data as it was obtained from Kaggle
 
 - The traffic_clean excel file is the cleaned file that was used for the data visualizations and which will be used for our dashboard creation
 
 - The visualizations.zip contains the screenshots/photos of the visualizations and can be used by the presentation team to design our presentation slides
